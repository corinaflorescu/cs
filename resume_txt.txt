PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
Research Assistant 								January 2015 – present
Machine Learning Group Lab, University of North Texas, Texas, USA. Advisor: Dr. Cornelia Caragea

Unsupervised keyphrase extraction
•	Used position and topic biased random walks to extract more comprehensive keyphrases for a document;
•	Developed a new compositional scheme to score multi word phrases which shows increase in the performance of keyphrase extraction up to 70% compared to state-of-the-art approaches

Supervised document classification
•	Used information accumulated in a document network and embedded it in a co-training framework to improve the topic classification task
•	Showed improvements over the early and late fusion of classifiers
