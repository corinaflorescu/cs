PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
• Research Assistant 								January 2015 – 2017
  Machine Learning Group Lab, University of North Texas, Texas, USA.

• Research Assistant 								January 2017 – present

Supervised keyphrase extraction
•	Investigated feature learning techniques to automatically discover feature representations of phrases that can be used for the         task of keyphrase extraction
•	Propose  a  framework that represents a document as a word graph and automatically learns feature representations of
phrases by exploring the connectivity patterns observed in the network.

Unsupervised keyphrase extraction
•	Used position and topic biased random walks to extract more comprehensive keyphrases for a document;
•	Developed a new compositional scheme to score multi word phrases which shows increase in the performance of keyphrase extraction up to 70% compared to state-of-the-art approaches
