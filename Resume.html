		  <p>SUMMARY</p>
	
<p>Research scientist with 4+ years of academic experience. I work in an area between machine learning,
natural language processing and text-mining. My research concerns the development of new methods
to identify short phrases in the text of a document such that those phrases best capture the topics
of the target document. I have developed several methods which benefits the indexing in scholarly. I
am well connected in the academic community and have been presenting my work/tutorials to various
natural language processing and data mining conferences. </p>

	<ol>
<li>Developed keyphrase extraction systems for extracting keyphrases from scholarly documents; This extraction task aids indexing of documents in digital libraries, and hence, leads to improved organization,
search, retrieval, and recommendation of scientific documents.
<li>Developed a feature learning framework for automatically discover patterns that keyphrases express.
<li>Developed a domain-independent supervised keyphrase extraction systems based on the learned representations.
<li>Developed a ranking model to keyphrase extraction, such that the model can rank keyphrases according
to their degree of representing the topic of a target document.
