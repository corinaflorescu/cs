		<p> KEYPHRASE EXTRACTION
		<ol >

		<p align="justify"> <I>Problem</I>. Keyword/keyphrase extraction is the task of automatically identifying terms (single-word or multi-word phrases)
        that represent the major topics covered in a document. In addition to providing a summary of the most relevant information in a document,
        keyphrases have successfully been used in Text Mining, Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing applications
        such as classification, searching, clustering or context advertisement. Due to their importance, 
        many approaches to keyphrase extraction have been proposed in the literature along two lines of research: 
        supervised and unsupervised. </p>
		<p align="justify"> <I>Project</I>. Intuitively, keyphrases occur at positions very close to the beginning of a document 
        and they occur frequently. Consider the previous paragraph as an example. One representative phrase is ``keyphrase extraction.'' 
        Notice that the phrase occurs very early (even from the project's title) and occurs frequently. Based on these observations, 
        we investigate unsupervised approaches that model the entire distribution of positions for a word. </p>
		
		</ol>
		</p>
		
		<p> DOCUMENT CLASSIFICATION
		<ol >
		
		<p align="justify"> <I>Problem</I>. Open-access digital libraries such as Google Scholar, CiteSeerX, and ArnetMiner 
		store and index millions of research articles and their metadata, and make it easier for researchers to search for 
		scientific information. An important aspect of a paper is its venue of publication, which reflects the authoritativeness
		of a paper. The availability of paper venues can help improve the search and retrieval of information in digital libraries.
		However, the venue of a paper is not always readily available but needs to be gleaned from other sources of information.</p>
		
		<p align="justify"> <I>Project</I>.  We explore a text-based approach to venue classification of research papers that are 
        freely available on the Web. We propose to take into account the topical influence of one paper on another 
        by incorporating keywords from the titles of cited papers, which precisely appear in the references list of a paper. </p>
